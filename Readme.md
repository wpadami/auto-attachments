## Description

Auto Attachments make your attachmens more effective. When you upload an attachment to your article, this plugin detects the attachment's type and creates a file list and a download area after <code>the_content</code>. If you add audio or video files, the plugin plays them inline using WordPress core's HTML5 audio/video player. Plugin works with mp3, ogg, mp4 and other video & audio types supported by WordPress.

**NOTICE**: Please set your thumbnail and big image sizes before uploading new images - changing these sizes doesn't retroactively resize already-uploaded attachments. Read [FAQ](faq/) please

The admin area (rebuilt in 0.11.0 - [look screenshots](#screenshots)) uses WordPress's native React-based settings UI. You can control all of the plugin's options, decide the downloadable files design (list or grid), and add header titles for video and audio files. You can find a .pot file in languages folder.
